# Mission-to-Mars

## Overview

The purpose of this project was to become familiar with Flask, Bootsrap 3, and MongoDB.

We used these tools to create a dynamic web app that scraps data about the planet Mars from number of different sources. Stores that data in a local Mongo database and uses Flask top inject the stored data into an html page.

Bootstrap 3 was used as the css resource for the project.
